It enters an infinite loop because the conditional part of the while loop assigns 1 to counter, rather than evaluating if counter is 1.  Assignment is truthy, so the loop condition is never false.

The 'break' line never gets a chance to execute, because its condition is counter being greater than 2, and counter always ends up being reset to 1, then turning 2.
